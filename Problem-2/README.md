# Problem 2
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index _i_ of the new array is the _product of all the numbers_ in the original array _except the one_ at _i_.

For example, if our input was _[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]_, the expected output would be _[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]_. If our input was _[3, 2, 1]_, the expected output would be _[2, 3, 6]_.
